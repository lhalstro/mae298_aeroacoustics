\section{Problem 1 -- Generalized Differentiation of Wave Equation} \label{SecGenDiff}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The acoustic wave equation without considering the source is expressed as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{AcousticWaveHomo}
\dfrac{1}{c^2}\dfrac{\partial^2p}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2p = 0
\end{equation}

We can define a new function $\widetilde{p}$ using the imbedding technique as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{Ptilde}
\begin{split}
\widetilde{p} =
    \left\{ \begin{array}{lll}
        p, & f > 0 \\
        0, & f < 0
    \end{array} \right.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $f = 0$ describes the arbitrary moving body. Show that the wave equation whose sound is
generated by an arbitrary moving body (f=0) can be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{AcousticWaveBody}
\dfrac{1}{c^2}\dfrac{ \overline{\partial}^2 \widetilde{p} }{ \partial t^2}
    - \overline{\nabla}^2 \widetilde{p}
= -\left[ \dfrac{M_n}{c} \dfrac{\partial p}{\partial t} + p_n \right] \delta(f)
    -\dfrac{1}{c} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} \left[ M_n p \delta(f) \right]
    -\nabla \cdot \left[ p \vec{n} \delta(f) \right]
\end{equation}

where $\vec{n}$ is the unit normal vector on the surface and $p_n = \nabla p \cdot \vec{n}$. Now we can use the Green’s function of the wave equation in the unbounded space, the so-called free-space Green’s function, to find the unknown function $p(\vec{x},t)$   everywhere in space. The result is the Kirchhoff formula for moving surfaces.

\section{Problem 2 -- Farassat Formulation 1A for Loading Noise} \label{SecFarassat}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Farassat’s formulation 1 for the loading noise is given as
4πp! 𝑥,𝑡 =1𝜕 𝐿! 𝑑𝑆+         𝐿! 𝑑𝑆
          𝑐𝜕𝑡 !!! 𝑟 1−𝑀! !"
!!! 𝑟! 1−𝑀! !"
    where L! = ∆𝑃 𝑛 ⋅ 𝑟 = ∆P cos 𝜃. This formulation 1 is difficult to compute since the observer time differentiation is outside the integrals. A much more efficient and practical formulation can be derived by carrying the observer time derivate inside the integrals (formulation 1A). Show that formulation 1A for the loading noise becomes
  4πp! 𝑥,𝑡 =1 𝐿!
𝑐 !!! 𝑟 1−𝑀! ! !"
    𝑑𝑆 !!! 𝑟! 1−𝑀! ! !"
𝑑𝑆+1     𝐿!(𝑟𝑀!+𝑐𝑀!−𝑀! )
       +       𝐿!−𝐿!
𝑐 !!!
𝑟! 1−𝑀! !
𝑑𝑆 !"
             whereL! =𝐿⋅𝑀.

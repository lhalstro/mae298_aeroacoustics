\section*{Problem Statement}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You are designing a new aircraft engine and analyzing acoustic propagation generated by a non-uniform flow with angle of attack interacting with rotating fans. You obtained flow fields from CFD for a one-sixth small scale of the engine. The radius for the small scale engine is 13 in and the hub radius is 3 in. CFD provides the velocity gust information as a function of its circumferential modes. The circumferential mode for acoustics can be expressed as $m = nB − kV$ where $B$ is the number of blades, $V$ is the number of vanes, $n$ stands for the harmonic of BPF and $k$ is the integer (1, 2, 3...). You consider only positive $k$ at this time (this is related the rotation direction of gust). The number of blades is 18. The number of vanes is considered to be 1 since there is no physical vanes but there is one revolution difference. The Mach number is 0.525 and the fan RPM is 8326.3042, the speed of sound is 13503.937009 in/s and the density is 1.4988E-5 slug/in\^3. The dominant noise is generated at the 1st BPF or $n=1$ in which the
angular frequency $\omega$ is given as $RPM \times \frac{2\pi}{60}\times B$. We are interested in the propagation through the inlet of !"
the engine so that sound propagates to $–z$ direction assuming the $+z$ direction is in the flow direction.

1. [20 points] Determine the first five eigenvalues of acoustics for m=18, 17, 16, 15 or (k=1, 2, 3, 4) or (m,n)=(18,0), (18,1), (18,2), (18,3), (18,4), (17,0), (17,1), (17,2), (17,3), (17,4), (16,0), (16,1), (16,2), (16,3), (16,4), (15,0), (15,1), (15,2), (15,3), (15,4)

\section{Wavenumbers}

3. [20 points] Determine the wavenumbers in the z direction for (m,n)=(18,0), (18,1), (18,2), (17,0), (17,1), (17,2), (16,0), (16,1), (16,2), (15,0), (15,1), (15,2). Indicate whether the mode is cut-on (propagating) or cut-off (exponentially decaying). Consider only the propagation in the –z direction. Exclude the exponentially growing solution and include only the propagating solutions or exponentially decaying solutions.

\section{Modal Power Levels}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

4. [30 points] The pressure distribution file at z=0 plane for m=18 or 1 BPF is provided. The first column is the dimensional radius [in], the second column the real part of the pressure [psi], and the third column is the imaginary part of the pressure [psi]. Using this boundary condition, compute the sound power level for (m,n)=(18,0), (18,1), (18,2). This noise is considered for blade self noise that is not associated with the gust response since k=0. Note that the z=0 plane is not the same as the engine inlet. Use the conversion for the unit for the sound power as follows: $PWL(dB) = 10*\log_{10}(W_{mn}) - 10*\log_{10}(7.3756E-13)$
